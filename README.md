# Dijkstra-algo
This C++ project implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths in graphs. It supports both directed and undirected graphs, and can perform single-source and single-pair shortest path calculations. The project includes a min-heap implementation for efficient vertex selection, a graph building function, and various utility.
